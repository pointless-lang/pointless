subtitle:

Loops allow programs to run code iteratively (multiple times). Pointless has two
traditional looping constructs: `for` loops and `while` loops. Note that the
[mapping pipe](../pipelines#map) operator `$` is also used for iteration.

## For Loops

The most common form of a `for` loop has the syntax

```ptls --no-eval
for variable in sequence do
  ...block
end
```

statement map pipe

in which

- for loops
- while loops
- anon for
- tandem for
- tandem for list
- tandem for table
- for list table object set
