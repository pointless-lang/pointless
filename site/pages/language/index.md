The language reference describes the core language features of Pointless. The
reference is divided into chapters, each covering the syntax, semantics, and use
of a part of the language. Use the links below to view each chapter.

For information on the language's built-in functions, see the
[standard library](/stdlib) documentation.

### Reading Example Code

Many code samples, like the example below, show the values generated by the
code, including:

- Any printed values
- The value of each [top-level](/misc#top-level) [expression](/misc#expressions)
  (except for calls to [Console](/stdlib/Console) functions)
- If the final statement is a variable definition, the value of the variable

```ptls
word = "time"
print(word)

"what $word is it?"
"$word to get a watch."

backwards = reverse(word)
```
