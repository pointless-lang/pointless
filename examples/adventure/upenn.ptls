UPENN SIMULATOR VERSION 0.1.0 🏫

You find yourself in a UPenn courtyard, in a jungle of fences and construction equiptment.
You look around for a sign or a map... there are none.
It's 10:07 and you're late for class 🕒.

The building before you has two doors, a main door which is closed and a side door which is propped open.

Choose a door 🚪
"

game.rooms.mainDoor = "
You try the main door... it's locked
You knock loudly on the door until a security guard emerges from the building.

Guard 💂: 'CITIZEN: YOU NEED A PENN ID TO ACCESS THIS BUILDING.'

A hazy memory emerges from the depths of your mind.
Your Penn ID is on the second floor of the University bookstore 📕.
Why the bookstore? You can't remember 🤔.
You turn away from the building and begin the long walk up Walnut street.

It's 100 degrees. There is no shade 🌞. A single footstep requires every ounce of your concentration...
"

game.rooms.trip = "
You trip and fall.
The pavement is liquid, melted by the heat of the sun 🔥.
It envelopes you like quicksand. In an instant, you are swallowed whole 💀.
