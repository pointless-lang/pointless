Noon rings out. A wasp, making an ominous sound, a sound akin to a
klaxon or a tocsin, flits about. Augustus, who has had a bad night,
sits up blinking and purblind. Oh what was that word (is his thought)
that ran through my brain all night, that idiotic word that, hard as
I'd try to pun it down, was always just an inch or two out of my grasp
- fowl or foul or Vow or Voyal? - a word which, by association,
brought into play an incongruous mass and magma of nouns, idioms,
slogans and sayings, a confusing, amorphous outpouring which I sought
in vain to control or turn off but which wound around my mind a
whirlwind of a cord, a whiplash of a cord, a cord that would split
again and again, would knit again and again, of words without
communication or any possibility of combination, words without
pronunciation, signification or transcription but out of which,
notwithstanding, was brought forth a flux, a continuous, compact and
lucid flow: an intuition, a vacillating frisson of illumination as if
caught in a flash of lightning or in a mist abruptly rising to
unshroud an obviNoon rings out. A wasp, making an ominous sound, a
sound akin to a klaxon or a tocsin, flits about us, a sign - but a sign,
alas, that would last an instant only to vanish for good.
